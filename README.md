# Rate-The-Rockstar
A fun little android app that takes 5 musician/artists whose work I admire and I give the user the option to rate them. The ratings are saved for storing even after the app closes or switches activities. This app uses 2 activities. The main activity, where there is a scroll view of 5 different pictures of musicians, and an activity that gives a short little description and rating bar to rate the musician.
